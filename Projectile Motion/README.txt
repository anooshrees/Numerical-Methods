This folder contains the following documents:

1. An R script that can calculate the velocity and position of a projectile object in 4 different density models, and plot its position.
2. Analysis report that meets criteria in projectile motion handout from Athena.

Some basic notes:
1. All density models have an assigned color in the graphs (in the analysis report, but can be generated by the user using provided code):
   constant density = blue
   zero density = red
   adiabatic density model = purple
   isothermal density model = green
2. Only the position graphs contained in the paper (those using only default values for the constants) are provided, but the other graphs referenced in the paper can easily be created using the table of values in the paper and the code provided.
3. Default values for the constants were taken from the projectile motion hand out on Athena. I assigned the default values to the initial x and y position for the constant, zero, and adiabatic air density models, the initial firing angle, and the time intervals. For the three models, I assumed the projectile object was launched from the origin. I assumed the object was fired at 45 degrees, and I used a 0.0005 second step size over the domain [0,50].

And finally, Happy Holidays :)
