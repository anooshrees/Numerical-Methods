Some basic notes before going through this folder:
1. The .pdf files are the plots containing a graph of the approximation and the close form curve.
2. The approximation is the blue curve, the close form graph is the red curve.
3. The files are labelled by the starting angle of the pendulum, in radians. In fact, all of the graphs are in radians.
